                and international trade since the early 20th century, and its economy relies on revenues from trade,
                tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of
                the city. However, oil production contributed less than 1 percent to the emirate's GDP in 2018.</p>
